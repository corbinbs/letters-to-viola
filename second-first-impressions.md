# second first impressions

Dear Viola,

Several years ago, my wife and I signed up for every foster care and adoption 
list we could find.  We did all the required training.  We got our house inspected 
to ensure it met all of the specifications for providing foster care.  We'd heard 
that there were many children from newborns to teenagers from all backgrounds that
needed help. We wanted to help one of these children.  We knew we couldn't change 
the world by ourselves but we felt like we could help change the world for one person.
We waited and waited but never got a call.  We knew many of the agencies were 
overhelmed so we remained patient.  After a few years, we'd pretty much given up 
hope of helping a child and continued along in our lives thinking that it just 
wasn't meant to be.

Meanwhile, I'm working at a tech startup as the first full time engineer.  
The co-founders took a big risk to make "the overalls guy from South Carolina" a 
cornerstone of their initial team.  They could have picked anyone based on their 
backgrounds and networks.  They both had ties to rural areas and wanted to give me 
a shot to help set an example for other rural problem solvers.  They allowed me to 
work remotely from the old textile mill village where I grew up so others around me 
could see that it's actually possible.   

In 2016, I submitted a talk proposal to PyCon (the largest annual gathering of folks 
using and developing the Python programming language).  I didn't expect to hear anything 
back about it.  I've always considered the speakers at conferences like PyCon some of 
the very best at what they do.  I didn't think I had much of a chance.  
When the time came to announce the talks, I received an email back saying that my talk 
proposal had been accepted.  I was surprised and excited about the chance to speak at 
the conference.  I decided that I was going to use the opportunity to thank professors, 
the co-founders, family, and as many of my fellow team members as I could reasonably 
weave into the talk while still communicating the core content.  
I'd saved up some points from a credit card along with some SkyMiles.  
My wife and I used those to book travel to the conference in Portland, OR.  
I bought an individual conference ticket.  I didn't want the company to 
pay anything (even though they actively encouraged submitting talks to conferences and 
would have provided travel) because I was going to thank some folks. I didn't want my 
thanks and the overall talk to be confused as "paid promotional content."  It was all 
genuine from me.  I felt like I had a pretty good talk when it was all done.  
(You can watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVNaxNDN5ok) of it and see 
what you think.)

After the talk, a lot of folks told me they enjoyed the background stories blended into 
the talk as much as the technical parts of it.   I'd tried my best to share my feelings 
about how we should treat people in general and within the tech community as a background 
theme throughout the talk.   At that time, I didn't know that in just a few days I was 
going to be presented with a much bigger opportunity to once again demonstrate those 
feelings with actions and not just talk...

After working from Portland during the conference, we flew back home for a couple of 
days to prepare for a trip back out to Seattle for some really big meetings.   
A lot of major companies were going to be there to see a live demo of some new software 
we'd been working on.  I was going to be running that live demo.  It was the second day 
back when I was on an "All Hands" video conference.  My wife came into the room 
where I typically work.  She managed to get my attention.  I looked over to my right 
and she said: 

> We got a call.  
> I'm going to help a child.  
> I'd like for you to come with me.  
> We need to go now.

It took a moment for that to register with me.  I'm always so focused on fixing and 
making things that my brain needed a bit longer to realize that we'd finally gotten 
a call to help a child.  My wife knows how to bring out the very best in me.  Sometimes
she does it via a subtle hint and other times it's very direct language.  On this day,
there was no time for that gentle nudge to step up and do what's right.  She gave me the 
push I needed to jump into action.  Once all of that registered, I dropped from the video 
conference.  We got in the car and headed to check on the child.  
I was able to sync up with folks at work while in the car and they were all excited 
for us.  Because of the timing, I needed to rearrange some travel to ensure that we 
could help the child and I could still make it to Seattle on time to help support the team.
Everyone worked quickly to make it happen.  We were able to go see the child and make 
sure she was doing OK.  She was so small but yet so very strong.  She would need to remain
under medical care for a bit, so I let the medical staff do what they were trained to 
do.  I continued to work while periodically checking back in on the child.  Sometimes the most 
exciting events in your life come in rapid-fire bursts.  It might be easy to avoid 
helping someone when so much is going on in your life but those are the moments that 
offer us the chance to grow the most and really demonstrate our true character.  

After arriving in Seattle, I tried to focus on practicing the demo over and over to 
make sure things were all dialed in.  As much as I tried to focus my mind on the tasks 
I needed to complete, I kept thinking "I hope the child is OK.  I hope her biological 
parents are OK."   When the time came for the real demo, I was thankful I'd practiced 
so much.   The demo went really well but I was almost on 100% autopilot.  
In the same way athletes practice over and over so that they develop muscle memory, 
I'd develped "demo memory."  My mind was still looping over "I hope the child is OK.  
I hope her biological parents are OK." as I presented to VPs, C-Levels, and
other folks that a guy from Clifton, SC just doesn't typically encounter.  
After successfully navigating all of that, I was able to return home and meet back up 
with my wife and the child.  We were able to provide foster care for her and then adopt 
her later that same year.

You are that child, Viola.  You've already taught me so much and you're still pre-school
(at the time of this letter).  You learn new things at an incredible rate.  
Some days I think you've literally grown a couple of inches overnight.  You make me laugh 
when you unexpectedly repeat things I've told you.  Like the time you told other 
kids: "That's 12 volts.  Don't touch."   How many other small children are going around 
talking about 12 volts?  You're my #1 partner in off-the-grid solar power work.  

I don't know your biological father but I do know that I cannot replace him.  
He's most certainly experienced things that I can never really know.  Even though 
I can't be your "father", I hope that many years from now you will consider me to 
have been a good "dad." 

Folks will often say that it takes an entire community to raise a child.
We've been extremely blessed to receive help and advice from different people 
throughout our local community and from folks in the tech community.   
We've received the finest cloth diapers, the best bedtime story books, natural hair care 
tips and suggestions for the best conditioners for 4C curls, tons of clothes, etc.  
I believe you are truly special and likely to become a great leader one day.  
My grandma used to tell me I was special everytime I went to eat leftovers at her house.
(Grandma leftovers are way better than fresh meals at a restaurant!)
I think most grandmothers probably tell their grandkids something like that.   
They're the wisest folks on earth.  My grandma knew that I'd likely face difficult 
times trying to make significant contributions to computing having a Southern accent 
and being from a rural part of South Carolina. 
Big time computing is still not something associated with the rural South (at least not yet...).
My grandma knew that and so she worked extra hard to build me up every chance she 
had so that when other folks tried to tear me down or when I was struggling in 
graduate schoool, I'd still have enough humble confidence left to keep pushing.  

When I tell you:

> We love you! You're special!

multiple times per day, it's because I want to make sure you have enough humble 
confidence to safely navigate through whatever you may encounter.   My path has 
not always been easy but I know that your path will likely be much more difficult.
An African-American girl growing up in the rural South with white adoptive parents 
is not likely to help you avoid teasing in school.  I know you didn't pick this path.
My hope is that with plenty of community support, you'll safely navigate through the 
hard times you do encounter and build up a unique skill set that will help you 
realize your purpose and help more people along the way.  Your mom and I are always 
working to make sure you've got plenty of exposure to folks that do look like you
(as teachers, community leaders, and friends) so you can learn from them the things 
we may not know (or may not be qualified to speak on).  
The great Lee Haney likes to remind folks:

> no pain no gain and remain the same

Just like in bodybuilding, we can't really grow as people without crossing over 
the pain barriers.  Some folks have much tougher paths than others.  I don't know if 
you will elect to pursue a path that involves technology or computing.  
I do want to make sure you have every available opportunity to follow your dreams, though.  

As you go through life, you might hear folks quote:

> You don't get a second chance to make a (good) first impression

It is true that there's only one "first impression."
Sometimes the folks we encounter in life won't look like we do.  They might look like 
characters we've previously seen on TV, read about in books or even met before.  
Some of these people will be ignorant and maybe even evil.  
Some of them will end up becoming our best friends and maybe even family members.  
When people first meet me without any context, they see a white guy in overalls and 
hear a Southern accent.  Then they learn that I'm a South Carolinian.  At this point,
some people (and most current machine learning algorithms) might classify me as 
uneducated and maybe even a racist.  If they allow themselves to capture a _second_ 
impression of me, they'll see me holding your hand.  They'll hear us talking about 
electronics and computing (and legos, baby dolls, hair conditioners, fried okra and ...)
They'll see the love and support that every good dad shows their child.  You've 
taught me about the importance of second first impressions, Viola.  
You've taught me that we need to give more folks the opportunity to provide us with 
a _second first impression_ because those may be the people that don't look like us 
or match some sort of stereotype but that end up being our best friends, co-workers, 
and community members once we get to know them more.  As you continue to navigate your 
path in life, you'll always have my full support.  Everything I've learned on my path 
now belongs to you.  I'll help you avoid all the mistakes I've made.  Everything I 
have will ultimately belong to you.  Please use it to reach out and help others when that 
time comes.

> We love you! You're special!

Love,

Dad
