Dear Viola,

When you're young, time seems to move in slow motion.
When you're old(er), a decade passes in what seems like the blink of an eye.
Our perception of time seems to be what changes over the years.
If I could go back in time and tell myself one thing it would be: 
_*appreciate time*_.  I can't go back in time but I can pass along 
this bit of wisdom to you with the hope that you can benefit from it as
you navigate your path in life.
Most of my life has been a non-stop race.  A race against myself to see 
how much I can do and how fast I can do it.  Solving problems quicker.
Writing code faster.  Rushing to hurry through college... so I can try to 
hurry through grad school... so I can try to hurry and check off the other 
things that I want to do.  When I was growing up, you'd often hear "don't be lollygagging."
You didn't want to be caught wasting time.  There was work to be done.
We always tried to make the work fun, too.  It's funny how some memories
from long ago stick with you as if they were earlier that same day.
I've never lacked a sense of urgency that so many folks seem to lack.
If anything, my sense of urgency has been optimized over time. 
That's served me well in most of my pursuits.  I've not always done very
well at unleashing that urgency on work and then stepping aside from it periodically 
to enjoy living in the present with friends and loved ones.  
To really _*appreciate time*_ to the fullest, I believe you really do 
need to master the ability to move in and out of these modes.   
We don't have an infinite amount of time.  We don't know how much time we'll have together.
Focusing on completing the things that matter to you as fast as possible is important.
Enjoying having fun with the folks that are serving with you and supporting you 
along the way is also important.  I don't have a magic formula for knowing when 
to switch between these modes.  Sometimes you might be in deep thought (aka `the zone`) 
and really want to solve a tough problem.  Stepping away from it in that moment to 
halfheartedly spend time with friends is probably not the best use of their time or yours.
I've lost track of the number of times I've "lost track" of time working to solve a problem.
It was 8am when I started and then 8am the next day when I realized I probably should
take a break.  Never stopping to let your mind separate from those tough problems and capture 
a few quality moments with friends and family is definitely a mistake.
Your mind will likely have solutions to those problems when you return to work
and you'll have slowed down time for a brief moment with your friends to lock in
memories that will last your lifetime.  When I was a young boy, I enjoyed playing in the woods.  
I'd often lose track of time building forts or exploring old logging roads.  
Over the last several months, I've rediscovered all the things I love about those woods.
Don't underestimate the benefits of talking walks by yourself in an environment that you love.
For me, that's the woods.  Time seems to move slower in the woods for me.  Stuff I couldn't 
work through in front of the computer, I can spin into a background process in my noggin 
and go walk loops in the woods while it processes.  When I come out of the woods, I've 
usually got answers or have at least made some decent progress on those problems.
Finding the right balance between these modes of operation will be key to your success
(where "success" is what you define it to be - not what others tell you what "success" is for you).
There will likely be periods when you don't have a perfect balance between these modes.
That's OK.  Your life's work will ultimately balance out with family/friends time as long 
as you remember to _*appreciate time*_.

> We love you! You're special!

Love,

Dad
